# JS Fun Museum

[Live](https://zaharano.github.io/fun-js-museum/)

When museums started making digital collections available a few years ago, I started to play around with the high quality images made available. I started by making videos of paintings that I cut into layers and created parallax and depth of field effects with in After Effects. I considered building VR environments with paintings that have playful features you can turn on and off like this (and such a concept might be worth revisiting in this new world where most people cannot go to museums for the time-being).

Recently though I started to use JS to take those same chopped up paintings into the browser with various interactive features. Just a bit of fun. Sorry to the incredible artists whose paintings probably deserve better than this!

Things I want to do - 
- Add a depth of field/focus effect slider(s) to the parallax images.
- Clean up the tracker.js lower its system hit (polling rate a thing?)
